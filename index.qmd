Greetings! My name is Nishant Bharali. <img src="images/wave.gif" width="40px"/>

I'm an engineer with experiences in software modeling, analytics, vehicle controls, machine vision and machine learning. For a living, I get to solve problems with data, currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Engineering. 

**Life is not an experience without obstacles worth thriving against!**

### Programming

I use Python, Java, MATLAB and C++ to develop and deploy packages, web apps, automation pipelines, machine learning workflows, and websites (this site was built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)). My daily toolkit also includes Python.

### Web App Development

My framework of choice for web app development is Java + [Spring](https://spring.io/) + [React](https://react.dev/) + [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/). With Spring, React and Jenkins, I can build enterprise-grade UIs on top of [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) that can be infinitely styled with HTML, [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), CSS, JavaScript, and more.

### Data Science Communities

There are a plethora of online and in-person data science communities to learn from and share your own experiences. Online communities for open-source languages and data science are incredibly welcoming and below are my favorites:

- [Data Science Hangout](https://www.rstudio.com/data-science-hangout/live-calls/ "Data Science Hangout hosted by RStudio's Rachael Dempsey, Thursdays at 12pm ET")
- [The Ravit Show](https://theravitshow.com/ "TRS, hosted by Ravit Jain, is a community for data science & AI practitioners")
