Greetings! My name is Nishant Bharali. <img src="images/wave.gif" width="40px"/>

I'm an engineer with experiences in product development, software modeling, analytics, vehicle control and testing, machine vision and machine learning. For a living, I get to solve problems with various kinds of data, currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Engineering. 

**Life is not an experience without obstacles worth thriving against!**

### Programming

I use Python, Java, MATLAB and C++ to develop and deploy packages, web apps, automation pipelines, machine learning workflows, and websites (this site was built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)). My daily toolkit usually includes MATLAB (various toolboxes), Simulink and Python currently. I am more inclined toward C++ these days and upskilling myself in the same.

### Web Development

My framework of choice for web development is [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) + [Spring](https://spring.io/) for the backend + [React](https://react.dev/) + [Redux-Saga Middlware](https://redux-saga.js.org/) for the frontend + [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) - pipeline staging for deployment and `CI/CD`.

With Spring, React and Jenkins, I can build enterprise-grade UIs on top of [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) that can be infinitely styled with HTML, [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), CSS, JavaScript, and more. These skills have been a bonus in my career as I was exposed to Agile fundamentals in the very beginning of my career as an intern at [Oracle Cerner](https://www.cerner.com/).

### More technical demonstrations can be seen in my work experience and projects.
