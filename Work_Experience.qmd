### *Department - Electrical and Electronics (Vehicle Electronics Software)*

## Product Development Engineer
*August 2022 - July 2023*

- Worked on projects focused on critical issues regarding `CDC (Cockpit Domain Controller)` Vehicles on a production level at mentioned original equipment manufacturer (`OEM`). 

- My work comprised of certification, debugging and testing processes of Wireless Android Auto and Carplay for the project by colloborating with our 3PL partners and vendors: `Visteon Corporation`, `Aptiv` and `Harmann International`.

- Debugged Infotainment system software in `C++` on a firmware scale and traditional `Python` on a development scale leading to a stabilized initial software release for the products.

- Commute work for bench-level and vehicle-level environmental testing to test WiFi, media playback and Bluetooth features of the infotainment system simultaneously with Navigation (`GPS`) implementation.

- Learnt & understood the hardware architecture, and performed unit testing on the `Silver Box` for 3 major projects `Mahindra XUV 400 EV`, the 2023 Electric Vehicle, `Mahindra XUV 700` and ` Mahindra Scorpio N 2023`.

- Supported the Principal Engineers with Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Software Requirement Documents (SRDs), and gained exposure on how to write the set of work instructions for each of them.

- Implemented `TCP/IP, UART, LIN (obsolete)` and `CAN` protocols upon Vehicle Electronic Control Units (ECUs) using various development tools and tested them using diagnostic tools which we will discuss about below.

- Received Green light approval from Google for Android Auto certification for the project `XUV 400 EV`, the 2023 Electric Vehicle and `Scorpio N 2023` leading to USD $1 Million p.a. in CAPEX approvals - $100K more than the ask.

### Tools

#### Vector CANalyzer v16.0

I have performed analysis on network data traffic in serial bus systems, CAN buses in the Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in the vehicle in our product using vector CANalyzer v16.0. We used CANalyzer to check whether and what type of communication is occurring on the network of a particular component. In addition to sending or recording data, interactive ECU diagnosis is also possible.

<div class="centered-container">
![CANalyzer System Flow Diagram](images/CANalyzer_block_diagram.jpg){.straight-img}
</div>

The physical tool that consists of all the components of CANalyzer inlcuding a OBD connection, is shown below:

![CANalyzer landing window which includes the manipulation of BUS channels, stress logging features, CAN Statistics and datasheet I/O](images/CANalyzer15_menu.png){.straight-img height="80%"}
</div>

Signal interference analysis of car speed, idle engine running, engine speed, temperature and gear status are some examples of data traffic testing I have performed to verify and check whether the Instrument Cluster is receiving the data (in the form of binary during transmission and testing) accurately from the required ECUs whose functionalities are being tested to display accurate information on instruments like `Speedometer`, `Odometer`, `Tachometer`, `Fuel-Level Gauge` and `Temperature Gauge`.

</div>

##### Vehicle Safety (Crash Tests - GLOBAL NCAP)

The OEM's flagship SUV XUV700 also secured five-star rating in the adult occupant protection program and four-star rating in child occupant protection program. However, with an overall safety score of 57.69 points, it now sits slightly lower than the Scorpio-N.

Mainly, my work revolved around the electrical architecture of the vehicle and especially, cockpit electronics, I supported the Functional Safety CAE team with testing configurations during crash tests during the minimization of time frame between the impact and airbag deployment.

<div class="centered-container">
![Testing example for functional safety](images/CANoe_test_window.jpg){.straight-img height="90%" width="90%"}
</div>

#### OBD II Scanner

It can be plugged into almost every modern vehicle's OBD port to get valuable information and real-time data about vehicle systems. A wireless scanner can connect to your cellphone through Bluetooth, and let you access your car's data through a mobile app.

#### Garuda II Auto Diagnostic Tool

Garuda is a fully indigenous product from the GlobalEdge stable, provides vehicle network monitoring, re-programming, and diagnostics for a variety of applications, including passenger cars, trucks, buses, off-highway vehicles, and DG set applications. Its compact size, plug-and-play model, and PC connectivity through USB 2.0 and Wi-Fi make it exceptionally user-friendly, even in remote or rugged conditions.

- **Ethernet in Automotive**: Capturing and analyzing Ethernet frames for high-bandwidth applications like infotainment and advanced driver assistance systems.

- **Security Analysis**: Monitoring network traffic for security vulnerabilities and potential cyber threats in automotive systems.

- **Protocol Development and Testing**: Supporting the development and testing of new automotive communication protocols and systems.

- **Telematics and Fleet Management**: Capturing and analyzing communication between vehicles and backend servers for fleet management and telematics applications.

**My contribution:**

As it is a proprietary protocol, I had to reverse engineer the data. It might or might not be encrypted so one might need luck in being able to decipher the messages. In my experience, a lot of protocols have some sort of PDU structure with a length and/or sequence number in them, that is where I expanded my domain on PDU's and continuing to learn further currently.
